Test20 - lot of ds[k] type loads. Instead Assumed, temp = ds[k] and used temp everywhere
Test7 -  float3 into 3 float variables, Line 47,48,49 - VAR_MOMENTUM+0,1,2 removed, calculated as addition, basially doing compiler optimizations on my own to get to answer! since if var_momentum=0, simply optimized
