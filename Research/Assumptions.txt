Test20 - lot of ds[k] type loads. Instead Assumed, temp = ds[k] and used temp everywhere
Test7 -  float3 into 3 float variables, Line 47,48,49 - VAR_MOMENTUM+0,1,2 removed, calculated as addition, basially doing compiler optimizations on my own to get to answer! since if var_momentum=0, simply optimized
Test 9 - Multiline initialization instead of something done in one line
Test 18 - Multiline initialization instead of something done in one line

Test20 - Changed lines related to indirect memory access pattern. A[B[i]] where B[i]=i-1 is replaced to A[i-1]. This allows the parser to detect that the memory access pattern is regular
Test21,22 - Same as Test 20

   not allowed. Reason - Issues with scope. Which looks at prev and currentLine. So initialized twice
6. pseudoAST cannot differentiate between -1 constant a-1
