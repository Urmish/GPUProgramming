CompInt
--------
1) Test 1 - new_dw = ((ETA * delta[j] * ly[k]) + (MOMENTUM * oldw[k][j]));

delta[j] * ly[k]) + (MOMENTUM * oldw[k] identified as mem[A+B] pattern while delta[j] * ly[k] identified as mem[A*B] pattern. Even after no greedy search. 
Difficult to come up with patterns that identify mem[A*B[i]*k] and dont give issues like above. Also filtering out adds from mem[A+B] is important.

As a result, total arithmetic inst - 7 instead of 9 and compint is (7/8) instead of (9/8)
